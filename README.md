# Realtime Facial Expression Recognition Demo

This repository provides a real-time facial expression recognition demo based on the model proposed in our AAAI 2025 paper:  
[**"Navigating Label Ambiguity for Facial Expression Recognition in the Wild"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09993)

The model has been fine-tuned and deployed to operate on live webcam input, allowing real-time inference and on-screen visualization of facial expressions.

---

## Description

- Uses the trained NLA (Navigating Label Ambiguity) model
- Captures webcam input and detects faces
- Performs expression classification in real time
- Displays prediction results (e.g., emotion labels or softmax distribution) on the video stream
